Noise-Tester
============

An extendable tool for testing noise-generation algorithms. Scalable visualizers for both one and two-dimensional noise are included, with quick-switching controls. Adding new noise functions is fairly easy, by inheriting from one of the included noise generators and overriding a single function. Basic noise generators are included, such as non-interpolated, linear-interpolated, and cosine-interpolated noise. A few more advanced noise generators are also included, such as one for Perlin Noise, and two noise generators of my own design. Both one and two-dimensional versions of each are included.
